Throughout the movie, it is acknowledged that Maverick is a excellent pilot but has a dangerous and reckless flying style. Early scenes in the movie such as Maverick's encounter with an unnamed MiG-28, where he comes from above, canopy to canopy with the enemy pilot are proof of this. This both impresses some characters and annoys others due to the \"danger\" Maverick exposes them to.  src <a href=\"https://topgun.fandom.com/wiki/Pete_Mitchell\">Top Gun Fandom</a>"}}
